      <h2 class="mt0">ABOUT US</h2>
      <p>It has been recently reported that highly accurate classification, regression, and generation can be achieved by interpolative modeling of complex scientific data using machine learning models with high expressive power, such as deep neural networks (DNNs). However, many of the machine learning models used there are nonlinear functions with a large number of parameters, making the interpretation of the training results very difficult. In thermodynamics, Gibbs extended the theory of thermodynamics, which was the theory of heat engines, to chemical reactions, which was a great development in science. This shows that science has been greatly advanced by the scientific insight of human beings, who derive general principles beyond mere interpolation models and boldly extrapolate them. On the other hand, it is sometimes difficult to apply such insights to systems with complex non-periodic structures, such as those found in nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena. To address this situation, we believe that it is important to collaborate between machine learning, which is good at building interpolation models for complex data, and humans, who can make bold extrapolations based on scientific insights, and are developing methods for interpreting machine learning training results to bridge the gap between the two.</p>
